# Priority Deque
**To use:**
1. Download pdque.h header file.
2. Include it in your C++ program.
3. Declare priority deque variable as `priority_deque var_name`.

**Motivation:**
While implementing min heap for various questions using priority queue (Kth largest element, and Kth most frequent element), I thought to myself how cool it would be if priority queue could be accesed as a deque for pop() and back() functions. Hence, I ended up making priority deque.

**Supported Operations:**
1. push()
2. pop_front()
3. pop_back()
4. front()
5. back()
6. empty()
7. size()

**Constraints:** 
Works only for integer values.
